It is unfortunate that he was the first to fall to Lord Valthalak\'s evil minions.$B$BAs we fled from Valthalak, we were being pursued by a veritable army of his spectral assassins and stalkers. The flight from Blackrock Spire was chaotic, to say the least. Unfortunately along the way, Mor somehow lost his footing, though I suspect that he was pushed. In any case, he fell down in to the recesses of the lower portion of the spire.', 12340),

They had always exhibited a certain zeal in vanquishing any of the Scourge that we ran across in our travels, and it was suspected that their family had ties to the organization.', 12340),
	(2866, 'enUS', 'JARIEN AND SOTHOS, continued...$B$BSo it was that they found themselves facing the trials that are required of those that seek to join the Crusade. Of particular interest to them was a position of knighthood within the ranks; something that required more difficult testing apparently. For it was later discovered that Sothos actually failed his final test. Jarien would not have it though, and in open defiance she insisted that he be able to join her amongst the knights. From what we have gathered, Grand Crusader Dathrohan slew them both right on the spot in the middle of his chambers.$B$BThus it is that another of these haunted loci is The Crimson Throne inside The Scarlet Bastion at Stratholme.', 12340),

He proved himself invaluable in helping us to get out of a sticky situation we fell into there, however, and so he came on as one of the company\'s premier mages.$B$BThe odd thing about him though was the completely different nature of his two heads. One was always cheerful if not a little foolish, while the other was sly, calculating and had an almost dead look to its eyes. Kind of creepy really.', 12340),

The spectral assassins found entrance to the school all too easy, and slew him right there in front of his new master, Ras Frostwhisper.$B$BThis makes Ras Frostwhisper\'s chamber one of the haunted locations where the brazier can be successfully utilized.', 12340),

It is common for the leadership of the Spire to change hands, and unfortunately for us, we were going to play a part in the latest shift in power.$B$BWe\'d been commissioned by a goblin smuggler-wizard out of Booty Bay, Gremnik Rizzlesprang, to steal Valthalak\'s spellbook. We don\'t know if he wanted to study it or sell it (or both), and it doesn\'t matter now. What does matter is that we infiltrated the upper reaches of Blackrock Spire and slew Lord Valthalak in his lair. That\'s when the fun really began.', 12340),

He insisted on taking it as his share of the loot, which quickly devolved into a heated argument, and almost a fight, over the thing. We didn\'t know at the time that the amulet actually housed a good portion of Valthalak\'s spirit; we found that out later, much to our displeasure.', 12340),

But, even from the beyond, Valthalak sent his minions at us no matter where we hid. The Veiled Blade soon broke apart after that mission, and then we were really easy pickings.$B$BAs you must know, this makes Lord Valthalak\'s abode, what is now The Beast\'s chamber in Blackrock Spire, the last of the haunted locations.', 12340),

A weapon that would rival even the legendary Ashbringer in righteous fury.\n<BR/><BR/>\nThe Ashbringer derived its power from a shadowy artifact that had been purified in the Light and affixed to the blade. The Scarlet Crusade sought to do the same for its staff. \n<BR/><BR/>\nThe order sent its most loyal crusaders into the war-torn Plaguelands in search of a suitable relic. The few who returned bore a strange jewel bristling with darkness. Some sources say it had been part of a truncheon carried by one of the first death knights to walk the world. Other accounts hint that the dreaded lich Kel\'Thuzad had shaped the jewel with his spectral hands. \n<BR/><BR/>\nWhatever the truth, the Crusade would use the black gem to create the staff known as Light\'s Wrath.\n</P>\n</BODY></HTML>', 22566),
